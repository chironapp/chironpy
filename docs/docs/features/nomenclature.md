# Nomenclature

One of the main ideas behind chironpy is to offer a generic interface to data from different data sources.
A big part of this is making sure that the data frames that are returned by the `chironpy.WorkoutData.read_*()` methods (`read_fit()`, `read_tcx()`, etc.) are similar.
I.e. it should not matter if you are importing an activity from a .fit file or a .tcx file: Working with the data should be the same.

For the data frames returned by the `read_*()` methods, the column and data types are as follows:

| Column name        | unit                                                                                                         | comments                                                                                                                                                    |
